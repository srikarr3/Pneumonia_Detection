# Pneumonia Detection Using Flask and CNN  

This project is a Flask-based web application that leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Users can upload X-rays through a simple interface and receive instant predictions.  

---

## üöÄ Features  
- **Powerful Model**: A fine-tuned CNN for classifying chest X-ray images as *Normal* or *Pneumonia*.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Flask-powered web application for uploading images and displaying predictions.  
- **Robust Dataset**: Trained on a labeled dataset of X-ray images for reliable performance.  
- **Easy Deployment**: Lightweight application deployable on local machines or cloud platforms.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow  

1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Images resized and normalized for model compatibility.  

2. **Model Training**:  
   - Trained using TensorFlow/Keras to achieve high accuracy on pneumonia detection tasks.  

3. **Web Application Integration**:  
   - The trained model is integrated into a Flask app for seamless user interaction.  
   - Users upload chest X-ray images and get instant results.
